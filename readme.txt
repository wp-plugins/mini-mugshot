== Usage ==

= Sidebar widget =

After activating the Mini Mugshot plugin, you will find a new widget (by the name of Mini Mugshot) to add to your blog's sidebar. You have three sizes to choose from:

* Mini (does not show activity)
* 3-line
* 5-line
* Now Playing (only shows music played)

To have your personalised Mini Mugshot shown, you will first need to enter in your Mugshot profile URL. To do this:

1. Visit [mugshot.org](http://mugshot.org/) (if you are not logged in, please log in).
1. The URL in your browser's address bar will change to look something like this: `http://mugshot.org/person?who=G3yH5GwMpAN1DW`.
1. Copy the URL in your browser's address bar, and paste it in the appropriate place in the widget configuration.

= Inline post or page =

You can display your Mini Mugshot plugin in a post or page, but only after you have installed the [fauxML](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fauxml/) plugin. Once you have installed fauxML, you can type in the following text inside a post or page to have your Mini Mugshot displayed:

* [mugshot url]

You will need to find your Mugshot profile URL and put it in place of the word "url" in the above syntax. You can also use these variations to get different sizes:

* [mugshot-mini url]
* [mugshot-3 url]
* [mugshot-5 url]
* [mugshot-nowplaying url]
